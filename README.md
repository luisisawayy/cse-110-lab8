**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?**

Graceful degradation relates to designing applications with the goal of delivering the best experience in ideal conditions, while still providing basic functionality to the application when conditions are poor, which would be something like low or no connectivity to internet. In this case, service workers enable graceful degradation by allowing web apps to cache important resources (such as JSON data, HTML, CSS, JS, and stored images), so even if the network is unavailable or slow, users can still access these core features of the app that are stored and cached. This improves the quality of the application overall.
